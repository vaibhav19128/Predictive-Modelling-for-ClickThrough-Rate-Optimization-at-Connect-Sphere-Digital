# Predictive Modelling for Click-Through Rate Optimization

## 📊 Overview
This project aims to *predict the Click-Through Rate (CTR)* of users in an online advertising platform using *Logistic Regression*. The goal is to determine whether a user is likely to click on an advertisement based on factors such as:
- Daily time spent on site
- Age
- Area income
- Daily internet usage

The dataset used is advertising.csv, which contains user behavior and demographic data.
